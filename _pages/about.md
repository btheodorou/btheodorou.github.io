I am a PhD Student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests fall broadly in the domain of machine learning for healthcare and more specifically on generative models and their applications. I am especially interested in exploring work which can generate a positive real-world impact through methods that are fair, interpretable, and/or work to make data and models more readily available. When I am not working on research I enjoy cooking, traveling, and playing or watching sports. Feel free to explore this page to see my publications, CV, and learn a little more about me.
