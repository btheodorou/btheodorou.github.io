I am a PhD Student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests fall broadly in the domain of machine learning for healthcare and more specifically on the tasks of clinical trial optimization and synthetic patient data generation. I am especially interested in exploring work on these tasks which can generate a positive real-world impact throuhg methods that are fair, interpretable, and/or work to make data and models more readily available. I am currently working on a suite of projects related to generative modeling. When I am not working on research I enjoy cooking, traveling, and playing or watching sports. Feel free to explore this page to see my publications, CV, and learn a little more about me.
